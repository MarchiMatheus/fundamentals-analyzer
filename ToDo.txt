This is a document that has my ideas to implement and the next steps to improve in this program

* Add more fundamentals to the grade composition
* Create an different grade calculation method: Weighted Average, Custom grade
* Create README file and instructions to install needed libraries from import
* Create a configured grade system based in user input information
* Create a function in each fundamental class that receive a company ticker, information name and period and returns the value
* To the data that is not in percentage, create a system to compare it's grow over the years. If it has grown (true or false) and
    one more robust can be calculate the % of growth year to year, give a grade on that percentage and them create an average of all that
    percentage grades. Can be done in the Net Profit fundamental
* Implement List Comprehensions


Improvements made:
* Replace words characters with accentuation
* Add more companies data to the grade historic
* Create proper documentation
* Add a search for the year fundamental numbers
* Configure more grades to small fundamental numbers
* Make the core calculation engine class
* Add Net Profit to the grade composition
* Implement errors (i.e. column not found in the column, file not found, etc) with throw and catch (try except in the calculation API)
* Add a penalty for less year data. < 5 (7), 5-7 (8), 8-10 (9), >10 (10)
